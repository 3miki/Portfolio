                        </header>
                        <p>
                            I am a London-based Computer Science graduate with an MSc, transitioning from a background in sales and marketing to pursue my passion for technology. 
                            <br><br>
                            My journey into tech began through website design collaborations, which sparked my interest in in the impact of digital platforms and their ability to drive business growth. I also developed a passion for automation, using VBA and Apps Script to streamline repetitive tasks and improve efficiency. During the COVID-19 pandemic, when my job was severely affected, I began learning Python to expand my skill. Later, working in customer support, I encountered technical challenges that motivated me to learn how to solve problems at their core.
                            <br><br>
                            With experience in travel and marketing, I focus on building efficient, user-centred software solutions. I’m particularly excited about the potential of generative AI and large language models to solve real-world problems.
                            <br><br>
                            Beyond tech, I enjoy hiking, birdwatching, and plant-based cooking, and I’m committed to sustainability. I’m always open to connecting for collaboration or discussing projects.

                    <ul>
                        <li><b>Encounter with Cybersecurity</b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>While studying abroad in the USA, my computer was hacked by trojan malware, which caused panic. Thankfully, the campus tech support team helped me recover and replaced my security software with a more suitable one, which sparked my interest in technology and cybersecurity.</li>
                                <li>Afterward, I bought a MacBook Pro and started experimenting with hardware upgrades, such as changing the hard drive and memory. This hands-on experience helped me learn about computer components and repairs.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    
                        <li><b>First Professional Experience in Travel Industry</b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>After graduation, I was eager to contribute to Japan’s recovery from the Great Earthquake by working in the inbound travel sector. I joined a travel agency as a sales and tour conductor, where I gained experience and industry knowledge.</li>
                                <li>As my company ventured into inbound travel services, I collaborated with a web designer to create a website for a new business targeting global expansion. This project ignited my interest in web development and highlighted the power of digital tools in driving business growth.</li>
                                <li>During the COVID-19 pandemic when the travel industry was significantly affected, I took the opportunity to learn Python to develop my coding skills and explore ways to automate processes such as Apps Script.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    
                        <li><b>Multi-tasking at Marketing Company</b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>At a marketing company in the UK, I took multiple roles, including customer support and content writing. As reporting was crucial but time-consuming due to poor software integrations, I implemented VBA to automate tasks, improving efficiency in data handling and reporting. This freed up time to improve customer interactions and design user-friendly web content. 
                                <li>Despite my efforts, technical issues often prevented me from fully resolving customer problems, which led to frustration. This motivated me to dive deeper into solving technical challenges at their core.</li>
                                <li>Outside my job, I started learning JavaScript to develop my web development skills, as my work involved HTML and CSS to create engaging web content. I also participated in hackathons and workshops, applying my skills in real-world projects and expanding my portfolio.</li>
                            </ul>
                        </li>
                    
                        <li><b>Transition to Tech</b>
                            <ul>
                                <li>I enrolled in a Computer Science MSc program to deepen my technical knowledge. For my dissertation, I explored large language models and created AI projects to solve real-world problems, applying both my academic knowledge and practical work experience.</li>
